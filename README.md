# CASPER theme for hugo

Fork of [vjeantet's great hugo-theme-casper](https://github.com/vjeantet/hugo-theme-casper). Adjustments:

- Integrated [liqenyip's nice hugo-easy-gallery](https://github.com/liwenyip/hugo-easy-gallery/) and made them work within the theme.
- support non-root base urls (e.g. "http://domain.de/bla") in conjunction with image references in the theme and gallery.
- minor format and style changes (margins, paddings, text align, sans-serif font family)
- remove "authorlocation" and "authorwebsite"
- `google-maps` shortcode and styling.
- clean up document outline (`hn` tags only for content)
- featured image for each post on index page
- remove blog logo
- to be continued...
